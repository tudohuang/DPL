# PCB Design

This folder contains the Gerber files for manufacturing the PCB of the Digital Physics Laboratory project. These files are ready for direct submission to a PCB fabrication service.

## Files
- `design_project_top.gtl`: Top copper layer.
- `design_project_bottom.gbl`: Bottom copper layer.
- `design_project.gko`: PCB outline layer.
- `design_project_drills.xln`: Drill file for vias and holes.

## How to Use
1. Submit these files to a PCB manufacturer (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay).
2. Specify the board thickness and finish type as per your requirements.
3. Verify the design using a Gerber viewer before submission.

## Notes
- The PCB includes isolation between analog and digital sections to minimize noise.
- Ensure you procure components as per the Bill of Materials (BOM) for assembly.
